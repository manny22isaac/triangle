# Triangle
This isn't a triangle waveform- this is actually a squarewave form. Using the osc_api.h header file i copied some of the code and did some minor changes. As a warning this is an extremely power synth--so BE CAREFUL!!
There will be new waveforms coming soon free to download as well. Starting with an actual Triangle, white noise, Summing Sine waves, and others so stay tuned!
