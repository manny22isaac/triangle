# Triangle
This isn't a triangle waveform- this is actually a squarewave form. Using the osc_api.h header file i copied some of the code and did some minor changes. As a warning there are some bugs and tuning issues with some of the keys, so BE MINDFUL!!
There will be new waveforms coming soon free to download as well. Starting with an actual Triangle, white noise, Summing Sine waves, and others so stay tuned!
