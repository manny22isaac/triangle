# Triangle
This isn't a triangle waveform- this is actually a squarewave form. Using the osc_api.h header file i copied some of the code and did some minor changes.
There will be new waveforms coming soon free to download as well. Starting with an actual Triangluar, white noise, Summing Sine wave, and others so stay tuned!
